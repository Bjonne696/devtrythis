Goal:
Implement a complete frontend flow and user interface for cabin owners who must activate a monthly paid subscription before publishing or keeping their cabins visible on the platform.
There are two tiers:

Standard Plan: NOK 99 / month

Premium Plan: NOK 149 / month

The system should also detect user roles so that users with the role admin can publish cabins without payment.

Context

Stack: React 19 (Vite), styled-components, React Router 7

Backend: Supabase (handled separately — only simulate or mock responses here)

Pages/components affected:

NewCabinForm.jsx

NyHyttePage.jsx

MyProfileData.jsx (optional)

PersonvernPage.jsx

UX priority: both mobile and desktop

Requirements and Behavior
1. Subscription Check & Paywall

When a user with the role host (or equivalent non-admin role) tries to create or edit a cabin via NewCabinForm.jsx or NyHyttePage.jsx, the system should check whether the user has an active subscription.

If no active subscription is found, display a paywall modal or banner prompting the user to activate a plan.

Admins (profile-role = admin) bypass this check automatically — they can publish cabins without payment.

2. Payment Plan Selection

Display both plans side by side in a clean, responsive layout:

Standard – NOK 99 / month

Premium – NOK 149 / month

Each plan should include:

A short description of the benefits (Claude can design simple placeholder copy)

A clear “Activate” button

Visible plan price and renewal info

When the user selects a plan, trigger a frontend function that would (in the real version) start the payment flow. For now, just simulate successful payment with a temporary mock state.

3. Post-Payment State

After successful mock payment:

Update the user interface to show Active Subscription: Standard / Premium.

Allow the host to continue publishing or editing cabins.

Visually indicate the active plan in both NyHyttePage.jsx and MyProfileData.jsx.

4. Profile Integration (MyProfileData.jsx)

Show a “Billing & Plan” section with:

Current plan name and status (Active / Inactive)

Button to “Upgrade / Cancel” (currently just mock buttons)

Information about next renewal and a short GDPR note about data storage (non-technical wording)

Ensure the section looks good in mobile view (collapsible cards, consistent padding, readable font sizes).

5. Privacy Page (PersonvernPage.jsx)

Add a short subsection called “Payments & Privacy”, written for Norwegian users but in English for now. Claude should generate text along these lines:

We process payments through secure Norwegian payment providers.
No card details are stored on our servers.
We only keep minimal information such as your selected plan, payment status, and timestamps.
You can request deletion or export of your data at any time.

Design & UX Guidelines

Follow KISS and DRY principles — reusable components for plan cards, paywall modal, and subscription status indicators.

Use styled-components for all styling (no inline CSS).

Maintain a consistent visual hierarchy between Standard and Premium plans (color, icons, and typography).

For mobile:

Use stacked card layout with full-width buttons.

For desktop:

Use two or three columns with hover effects and distinct plan colors.

Use friendly micro-animations for activating plan or closing modal (fade or scale-in).

Include toast notifications for success, error, or cancellation (simulate only).

Data Handling (Mock Only)

Use mocked Supabase responses (e.g., fake fetch to /api/mock/subscription-status) for now.

Do not connect to real database or payment provider.

Store temporary state in React (local component state or simple context).

Security & GDPR Considerations

Never store payment or card details in frontend state.

Use only mock metadata (plan, status, timestamp).

Prepare the UI to handle later integration with secure backend functions.

Add visible disclaimer about data processing on both the paywall and privacy section.

Edge Cases to Handle

If the user closes the paywall without selecting a plan → disable “Publish Cabin” button and show a warning toast.

If the mock payment fails → show an error state with retry option.

If an admin user accesses the page → skip paywall entirely and show “Admin account – payment not required.”

Ensure clear visual feedback for all states: active, inactive, pending, and error.

Deliverables Claude Should Produce

Complete UI/UX design and React implementation for:

Paywall modal or banner

Plan selection cards

Subscription status component in profile

Updated privacy section

Properly styled mobile and desktop layouts using styled-components.

Mock logic for checking subscription status and simulating payment.

Accessibility and ARIA-friendly implementation (buttons, modals, focus handling).

Example placeholder text for all labels and messages (ready for localization).
